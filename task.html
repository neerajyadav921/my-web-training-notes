                Till the 19th century, tourism in Himachal Pradesh was restricted only to a limited
                movement of pilgrims to a few spiritual destinations around the hills. Only when
                the British established their chain of hill stations did tourism receive recognition
                in the state. Tourism received a shot in the arm when the British declared Shimla
                "The Summer Capital of India" in 1864. Post-independence, more investment in the
                infrastructure sector led to the opening up of tourism in the state. However, the
                biggest boost to tourism occurred in the mid-80s and 90s.
